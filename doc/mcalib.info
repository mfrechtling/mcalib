1 Introduction to MCALIB
************************

Run-time analysis provides an effective method for measuring the
sensitivity of programs to rounding errors. To date, implementations
have required significant changes to source code, detracting from their
widespread application. In this work we present a system that automates
the quantitative analysis of floating point rounding errors, through
the use of C-based source-to-source compilation and a Monte Carlo
Arithmetic library.

   Monte Carlo Arithmetic (MCA) tracks rounding errors at run-time by
applying randomization to input and output operands forcing the results
of FP operations to behave like random variables. This turns an
execution into trials of a Monte Carlo simulation allowing statistics
on the effects of rounding error to be obtained over a number of
executions. Statistical measurements are then used to analyse the
results, sensitivity to rounding error is suspected if a high level of
variance is observed between trials. As an example, consider the
subtraction 11111113 - 11111111 in decimal arithmetic using 8
significant digits. In standard arithmetic, the answer is 2.0000000 and
7 digits of significance are lost due to cancellation. With MCA, the
answer for a particular trial is 2.xxxxxxx where the x’s are random
digits. Only the most significant digit will be unchanged over a number
of trials and so a large standard deviation will result. Despite the
advantages offered by MCA and similar techniques, tools for rounding
error analysis are not in common usage. It is believed that one of the
major barriers is that source code needs to be modified so that custom
libraries are called to execute the arithmetic operations. In this
work, the use of source to source compilation, supported by mixed
precision libraries, is advocated. The approach allows for the
implementation of a general purpose FP analysis tool that can be
applied to arbitrary programs without significant changes to the source
code. The implementation provides opportunities for wider adoption of
runtime error analysis, and allows developers to test both the accuracy
of algorithms and the suitability of different FP formats for a
particular implementation.

3 Background
************

3.1 Monte Carlo Arithmetic
==========================

MCA is designed to track information lost using finite precision
arithmetic by modeling inexactness using the application of random
perturbations. If x is a non-zero FP value of the form is a non-zero FP
value of the form x = (-1)^s m 2^e the inexact function is defined as:

       inexact(x, t, \xi) = (-1)^\s_x\(m_x + 2^\-t\ \xi)2^\e_x\
   where x \in R, x \neq 0, t is a positive integer representing the
virtual precision, \xi is a uniformly distributed random variable in
the range (-1/2, 1/2), (\xi \in U (−1/2, 1/2)) and m_x, e_x are the
significand and exponent of x. It is assumed that 0 < t \leq p. An
operation \circ \in \+, −, \times, \div\ is implemented as:

        x \circ y = round(inexact(inexact(x) \circ inexact(y)))
   This results in the inexact() function being applied to both
operands and the final result. Adjustments to the operands are referred
to as precision bounding and are used to detect catastrophic
cancellation, while adjustments to the final result are referred to as
random rounding and are used to detect rounding error. MCALIB performs
both precision bounding and random rounding by first applying a random
perturbation to each input operand, performing the required operation,
then applying a random perturbation to the result. The inexact()
function as implemented for MCALIB applies random perturbations using
uniform absolute random values. Values for \xi are uniformly
distributed over (−1/2, 1/2) with mean 0 and standard deviation
1/\sqrt\12\. If x is a random variable, then inexact(x) has a mean
E[x], (expected value of x), and a standard deviation of \sqrt\S[x]^2 +
2^\2(e−t)\/12\, (where S[x] is the standard deviation of the input x).
The virtual precision value t is used to control the level of random
perturbation applied during MCA.  This, in turn, controls the accuracy
of the Monte Carlo operations. A large t value will result in a smaller
exponent value for the operand perturbation, increasing the accuracy of
the operation. Similarly, a smaller t decreases the accuracy. In
practice, t is used to determine the minimum precision required to
perform specific operation accurately. The precision is set to its
lowest value then repeated computations are performed as the precision
is increased. When the required number of significant figures of the
result have stabilized (i.e the required accuracy has been achieved) the
minimum FP precision required to perform the operation accurately using
standard IEEE-754 FP operators is determined. The implementation
developed for this paper thus performs variable precision MCA, and the
value of t used by the MCA library can be modified at any time during
execution.

3.2 Source to Source Compilation
================================

Source to source compilation provides an effective tool for automated
code transformations, and when paired with error analysis techniques
allows for the implementation of automated SW verification. The C
Intermediate Language (CIL) is a high level language representation
including a set of tools for analysis and source to source compilation
of C programs. The CIL compiler cilly is implemented as a Perl script
that performs translations to C code as defined in a set of OCaml
modules provided as part of the CIL library. For the purposes of MCALIB
CIL has been used for transforming C FP operations into calls to the
MCALIB library. This has been done by first lowering the source code to
a single statement assignment form, then converting FP operations to
use MCALIB library functions. As an example the following single
precision multiplication operation:

   `a = b * c;'

   would be redefined to the following function call:

   `a = _floatmul(b, c);'

   where `float _floatmul(float a, float b)' is the MCALIB function for
handling single precision MCA multiplication. This process will result
in all supported FP operations being replaced with function calls to
the MCALIB library. It is important to note that although operations
are done in a higher precision, the storage requirements of the FP
variables remain unchanged. This avoids portability issues associated
with pointers and dynamic memory allocation.

3.3 Mixed Precision Implementation using MPFR
=============================================

MCA has been implemented within MCALIB as a set of library functions for
arithmetic and comparison operations. One of the primary difficulties
with implementing MCA is the need to extend the precision of the FP
format being tested in order to simulate infinite precision. The
precision level must include p machine bits and t virtual bits, a total
precision requirement of W = p + t, where W is the working precision of
the MCA operation. The MCALIB library also implements variable
precision MCA, allowing the virtual precision to vary between 1 \leq t
\leq p at runtime. To achieve this functionality the mixed precision
library MPFR is used for mixed precision arithmetic in MCALIB.

   For MCA functions, FP values are converted to mpfr_t type variables.
The mpfr_t type is a struct containing an arbitrary precision
significand and a fixed precision exponent. The precision of the
significand of any MPFR variable may be set independently at runtime to
any value between MPFR_PREC_MIN and `MPFR_PREC_MAX', i.e. 2 and 256
respectively. For the purposes of MCALIB, the maximum precision
required is W_max = p + t_max which evaluates to 106 when using double
precision operators. Rounding in MPFR adheres to the C implementation
of the IEEE-754 standard and the default rounding mode round to nearest
even is used for MCALIB.

   The function for implementing MCA for an individual operation is
shown below:

     float _mca_bin(float x, float y) {
         x = extend(x_f, p + t);
         y = extend(x_f, p + t);
         r = extend(0.0, p + t);
         x = inexact(x);
         y = inexact(y);
         r = mpfr_op(x, y);
         r = inexact(r);
         r_f = round(r, p);
         return r_f;
     }

   The FP operands are first converted to mpfr_t with precision W , and
the result variable is initialized with the same precision. The random
perturbation \xi  is applied to the input operands using the inexact
function as follows:

     mpfr_t _mca_inexact(mpfr_t x) {
         if (x == 0) {
             return x;
         } else {
             e_f = (rand() / RAND_MAX) - 0.5;
             e = extend(e_f, p + t);
             e = mpfr_mul(pow(2, exp_x - (t - 1)), e);
             x = mpfr_add(x, e);
             return x;
         }
     }

   The arithmetic operation is then performed using an MPFR operation,
rounded to W bits. Random rounding is then applied to the result using
the inexact function and the final result is then converted to its
original format by rounding to p bits.

4 MCALIB Interface
******************

4.1 Using the Shared Library
============================

Correct implemenation of MCA using MCALIB requies a small number of
manual modifications to the original source code, namely, the MCALIB
libary header should be inluded, MCA control parameters set to
determine the behaivour of the MCA implemenation, and the C standard
library random number generator, `rand()' should be correctly seeded.
For the purposes of this section these modifications will be
demonstrated on a sample arithmetic program implementing the Knuth Test:

     #include "stdlib.h"
     #include "stdio.h"
     #include "math.h"

     #define floatval_t double

     void knuth_test(void) {
         floatval_t a = 11111113, b = -11111111, c = 7.5111111;
         floatval_t u = a + (b + c);
         floatval_t v = (a + b) + c;
         printf("U = %g\tV = %g\n", u, v);
     }

     int main(void) {
         knuth_test();
         return 0;
     }

   A completed version of the modified project along with a Makefile
and the original un-modified source can be found in
`/.../mcalib-2.0.0/demo/' and can be executed using the following
commands:

     make clean; make
     ./knuth

   Alternatively the original implementation can be executed using:

     make clean; make knuth
     ./knuth

4.1.1 Headers
-------------

The first modification required is to add a delcaration including the
MCALIB header file `mcalib.h'. All variable and function delcarations
required for using MCALIB are performed in this file and it should be
included in any project using MCALIB. Modifying the example project to
include the MCALIB header file is shown below;

     #include "stdlib.h"
     #include "stdio.h"
     #include "math.h"
     #include "mcalib.h"

4.1.2 Control Parameters
------------------------

Implementation of MCA is controlled using two parameters, `MCALIB_T'
sets the value of the virtual precision, t, and `MCALIB_OP_TYPE'
enables and disables MCA. Pre-defined symbols are declared in
`mcalib.h' and can be used to control the implementation as follows;

   * `MCALIB_IEEE'

     Disable MCA functions and use standard floating point operators

   * `MCALIB_MCA'

     Enable MCA using both precision bounding, (inbound), and random
     rounding, (outbound).

   * `MCALIB_PB'

     Enable MCA using precision bounding only.

   * `MCALIB_RR'

     Enable MCA using random rounding only.


   Application of these control parameters to the worked example is
shown below. In this case we are setting the virtual precision to 24 to
test single precision performance and enabling the MCA functions for
the function `knuth_test()' only.

     int main(void) {
         MCALIB_T = 24;                      //Set the value of the MCA virtual precision
         MCALIB_OP_TYPE = MCALIB_MCA;        //Enable MCA functions
         knuth_test();
         MCALIB_OP_TYPE = MCALIB_IEEE;       //Disable MCA functions
         return 0;
     }

4.1.3 Seed for Random Number Generator
--------------------------------------

MCALIB utilizes the standard library function `rand()' to generate
random numbers for using in the `inexact()' function. As such the
random number generator should be correctly seeded in order to ensure
correct implemenation of MCA functions. The function `void
_mca_seed(void)' has been included as part of MCALIB for the purposes
of seeding the standard library RNG and should be called before any
floating point operators are used:

     int main(void) {
         _mca_rand();                        //Seed the random number generator
         MCALIB_T = 24;                      //Set the value of the MCA virtual precision
         MCALIB_OP_TYPE = MCALIB_MCA;        //Enable MCA functions
         knuth_test();
         MCALIB_OP_TYPE = MCALIB_IEEE;       //Disable MCA functions
         return 0;
     }

4.1.4 Using MCALIB with Source to Source Compilation
----------------------------------------------------

At this stage the worked example is ready to be compiled with MCALIB.
In order to access the MCALIB arithmetic functions to perform the
floating point calculations two options are available. The floating
point operations can be manually re-written using MCALIB arithmetic
functions;

     u = _doubleadd(_doubleadd(a, b), c);
     v = _doubleadd(a, _doubleadd(b, c));

   In this case the example can be compiled as normal, adding the option
`-lmca' to the compile command to link the shared libary;

     gcc knuth.c -o knuth -lm -lmca

   This process of re-writing floating point operations becomes tedious
for anything beyond simple examples, for this reason with have included
CIL extension modules that automatically re-write floating point
operations using source-to-source compilation. To use this function,
the original operations should be left unchanged;

     u = (a +  b) + c;
     v = a + (b + c);

   and compiled with the following command;

     cilly --save-temps --dofphooks --dosimplify --dooneRet --dofpsimplify
     knuth.c -o knuth_test -lm -lmca

   This results in the following compilation process;

     gcc -D_GNUCC -E -DCIL=1 knuth.c -o ./knuth.i
     /usr/local/libexec/cil/obj/x86_LINUX/cilly.asm.exe --out ./knuth.cil.c
     --dofphooks --dosimplify --dooneRet --dofpsimplify ./knuth.i
     gcc -D_GNUCC -E ./knuth.cil.c -o ./knuth.cil.i
     gcc -D_GNUCC -c -o ./knuth.o ./knuth.cil.i
     gcc -D_GNUCC -o knuth ./knuth.o -lm -lmca

   and the the original floating point operations being re-written as
follows, (as can be seen in the temporary file `knuth.cil.c';

     #line 14
         __cil_tmp6 = _doubleadd(a, b);
     #line 14
         u = _doubleadd(__cil_tmp6, c);
     #line 15
         __cil_tmp7 = _doubleadd(b, c);
     #line 15
         v = _doubleadd(a, __cil_tmp7);

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                      Version 1.2, November 2002

     Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

A.1 ADDENDUM: How to Use This License For Your Documents
========================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
