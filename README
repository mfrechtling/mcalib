Quick Install Instructions:

The following pre-requisite libraries should be installed using ap-get install
or its equivalent:

	- make
	- m4
	- automake
	- texinfo
	- ocaml
	- ocaml-findlib
	- libmpfr-dev

Before installing MCALIB the C Intermediate Language (CIL) compiler cilly should
be installed. MCALIB supports CIL up to v1.7.1, use subsequent versions will
cause build errors. The following steps should be used to install cilly for use
with MCALIB:

	- Download the CIL source from
	  http://sourceforge.net/projects/cil/files/cil/cil-1.7.1.tar.gz/download
	  and extract.
	- Copy the CIL extension modules fphooks.ml and fpsimplify.ml from
	  /.../mcalib-1.0.1/cil_ext/ to /.../cil-1.7.1/src/ext
	- Configure the installation using:
		./configure EXTRAFEATURES='fpsimplify fphooks'
	- Build using:
		make
	- Install using
		make install

MCALIB can now be installed using the following commands:

	- ./configure
	- make
	- make check
	- make install

Any issues with the build or install process should be reported to
